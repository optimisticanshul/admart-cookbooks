[![Cookbook Version](http://img.shields.io/cookbook/v/krb5_utils.svg)](https://supermarket.getchef.com/cookbooks/krb5_utils)
[![Build Status](http://img.shields.io/travis/caskdata/krb5_utils_cookbook.svg)](http://travis-ci.org/caskdata/krb5_utils_cookbook)

# Requirements

This cookbook requires the `krb5` cookbook, version `1.0.4` or greater.

# Usage

This cookbook is intended for use in creating secure Hadoop clusters. As such, it will add the HTTP service
principal to all other service principals. This can be disabled by setting `krb5_utils['add_http_principal']` to `false`.

# Attributes

* `krb5_utils['admin_principal']` - Initial administrator principal, created on KDC. Default `admin/admin`
* `krb5_utils['admin_password']` - Password for `krb5_utils['admin_principal']`. Default `password`
* `krb5_utils['keytabs_dir']` - On-disk location for storing keytab files. Default `/etc/security/keytabs`
* `krb5_utils['krb5_service_keytabs']` - Hash of service keytabs to create. Default `{}`
* `krb5_utils['krb5_user_keytabs']` - Hash of user keytabs to create, in the same format as `krb5_utils['krb5_service_keytabs']`. Default `{}`

Hash format:
```ruby
{ 'HTTP' => { 'owner' => 'hdfs', 'group' => 'hadoop', 'mode' => '0640' } }
```
